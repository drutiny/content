title: "#2819197 - Cloudflare workaround for Drupal 8 urlGenerator"
class: \Drutiny\Cloudflare\Audit\PageRuleAnalysis
name: cloudflare:drupal-urlGenerator-workaround
description: |
  By accessing a site an an unexpected base path (e.g. with index.php) a site may
  cache links in a way that could be considered a minor site defacement and
  possibly lead to a duplicate content SEO penalty too. It can also impact
  caching strategy.
remediation: |
  {{^settings.forwarding_url}}
  1. Add a page rule in Cloudflare with the matching pattern of `{{rule}}`.
  {{/settings.forwarding_url}}

  For this rule, ensure a Forwarding URL setting is selected and forwards to
  `{{settings.forwarding_url.url}}` with a status code of `{{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}`
success: |
  There is a page rule for {{rule}} which forwards to {{settings.forwarding_url.url}}
  with a status code of {{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}.
failure: |
  {{#settings.forwarding_url}}
  A forwarding URL was found forwarding to **{{settings.forwarding_url.url}}**
  with a status code of **{{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}**. Was expecting
  a redirect to **https://{{host}}/$1** with a status code of **301**.
  {{/settings.forwarding_url}}

  {{^settings.forwarding_url}}
  No redirect was found. Was expecting a redirect to **https://{{host}}/$1**
  with a status code of **301**.
  {{/settings.forwarding_url}}
parameters:
  rule:
    default: https://:host/index.php/*
  expression:
    default: settings['forwarding_url']['status_code'] == 301
  # settings:
  #   default:
  #     forwarding_url:
  #       url: https://:host/$1
  #       status_code: 301
