description: |
  A bug in the ACSF deployment process left codebases in the `tmp` directory
  which could lead to filesystem bloat and excessive inodes.
remediation: |
  Remove temporary workspace files. Directories older than 24 hours can be
  safely removed.
success: "No deployment workspaces found."
failure: |
  There are stable workspaces on the filesystem. These should be cleaned up
    {{# directories}}
      - {{ . }}
    {{/directories}}
