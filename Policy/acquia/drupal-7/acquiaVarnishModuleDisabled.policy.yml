description: |
  This Drupal module attempts to replicate the effort of the Varnish Cache 
  that is already available to Acquia Cloud applications. It will not work 
  with Acquia Cloud applications because it requires connections to the 
  load balancers, which Acquia does not provide. The Varnish caching 
  provided by Acquia works out of the box, as long as you use caching.
