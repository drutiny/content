description: |
  When uploading files with the dropzonejs module (included with Lightning) 
  to an application with multiple web servers served by a single load 
  balancer, the web server that processes the form submission may not be 
  the web server that received the temporary file in the AJAX request. 
  Upload files through the `/media/add` interface instead.
