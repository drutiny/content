description: |
  The minimum cache lifetime prevents Drupal from clearing page and block caches
  after changes are made to nodes or blocks, for a set period of time. This can
  cause unexpected behavior when editing content or when an external cache such
  as a CDN or Varnish is employed.
remediation: "Set the variable `cache_lifetime` to be `0`."
success: Internal cache is disabled.
failure: Internal cache is enabled. Currently set to {{reading}} seconds.
