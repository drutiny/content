description: |
  The Purge (7.x-1.x) module is not specifically incompatible, but can be 
  difficult to set up correctly. We suggest using Acquia Purge instead. 
  It is specifically intended for use on Acquia Cloud. Over time, these 
  modules are planned to merge. It is recommended to disable and uninstall 
  this module.
remediation: |
  Disable the Purge module: `drush pm-uninstall purge -y`.
success: The Purge module is not currently enabled.
