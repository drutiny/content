description: |
  Alternative PHP cache is not recommended on Acquia Cloud. It stores 
  data on a per-server basis, which can lead to different data being 
  served by different servers. It also uses memory that would otherwise 
  be used by OPcache. We recommend using Memcachedinstead. It is 
  recommended to disable and uninstall this module.
